# DiamanteDesk Bundle #

DiamanteDesk software extends basic OroCRM functionality. Its main purpose is to integrate customer support system into the Client's CRM system.

Using this comprehensive help desk, it is now possible to create support tickets within the CRM and associate them with any customer from the system. In DiamanteDesk, tickets can be assigned to specific users and grouped into Branches. This option allows grouping tickets related to a certain customer.

Currently, DiamanteDesk software is in alpha version. Eltrino team is making efforts to improve and increase the amount of features available to our clients.
